## Exploring Weather Trends Project

The aim of the project is to analyze and visualize the local and global temperature data. I have considered (Raleigh NC) as my local city and compared it with overall global temperature trends. This report focuses on providing four interesting insights/observations about the change in temperature trends. The trends about the weather data (local and global) have been visualized by using Excel, where SQL query is used to extract the data from Udacity website.

## Introduction

The change in weather trends have always been an interesting topic among scientist, politicians, environmentalists, and others. The goal of the project is to compare and analyze the similarities and dissimilarities between local and global temperature data. Observations can be made by visualizing the temperature data. The report consists of the following sections: I. Data extraction from database, II. Data manipulation methods and tools, III. Data visualization, IV. Data interpretation.

## Tools Used for Data Analysis

SQL
Microsoft Excel
Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (IDE)
Microsoft Visual Studio Code (Editor)

## Data Interpretation

There following observations were drawn after analyzing the data from line charts:

(1) Raleigh NC is hotter on average compared to global average temperature trend and the difference is consistent over time.

(2) Global and Raleigh NC average temperatures have seen a consistent incremental change around the starting of 1990, before that there were fluctuations in average temperature.

(3) The overall trend shows increase in temperature in both global and local level. This means the world is getting hotter. This trend is consistent over the last one hundred years.

(4) There is a significant increase in temperature can be observed in global data.
